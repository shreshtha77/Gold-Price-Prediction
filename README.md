# Gold-Price-Prediction

In this study, we use the Random Forest Regressor, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to predict gold prices based on historical data. Through ensemble learning, we aim to create an accurate and robust model to forecast gold price fluctuations. By dividing the dataset, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, we optimize the model's performance. The model's predictions offer valuable insights for investors and financial analysts, aiding informed decision-making in the dynamic gold market. Regular monitoring and updates ensure its relevance over time.
